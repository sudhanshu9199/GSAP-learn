# What is WebGL & three-js ?

## What is WebGL?
- **Full form:** Web Graphics Library.
- **Definition**: WebGL is a **JavaScript API** that allows us to create **3D (and 2D)** graphics directly inside a **web browser** — **without using any extra software or plugins.**

- It uses the power of your **computer’s GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)** to draw smooth and fast 3D scenes.

- But… working directly with WebGL is **very complex** 😓 — you need to write hundreds of lines of low-level code just to draw a simple cube.

### 🧩 Example Analogy:
Think of WebGL like a raw engine of a car 🚗 — powerful but hard to handle. You need a lot of knowledge to make it run smoothly.

## 🌐 What is Three.js?

- **Three.js** is a **JavaScript library built on top of WebGL.**

- It makes it **super easy to create 3D animations, models, and games** inside the browser.

- You don’t need to write the tough WebGL code — Three.js handles that part for you.

- You just tell it:
    👉 what objects you want (cube, sphere, etc.)
    👉 what materials (color, texture, light, etc.)
    👉 what camera view
    👉 and it renders everything beautifully 🌟

### 🧩 Example Analogy:
If WebGL is the car engine, then **Three.js is the whole car** 🚗 — ready to drive! You just control it with the steering (JavaScript code).

## ⚙️ Basic Three.js Setup (Simple Steps)

1. **Scene**: Like your stage 🎭 where everything happens.

2. **Camera**: The eye 👁️ that looks at the scene.

3. **Renderer**: The artist 🎨 that draws what the camera sees.

4. **Objects**: Things like cubes, spheres, models, etc.

💡 In short:
```text
Scene + Camera + Renderer = Basic 3D World 🌍
```

## 🌟 Why Use Three.js?

✅ Easy to learn for beginners
✅ Runs in browser (no download needed)
✅ Works on mobile, tablet, PC
✅ Big community + free to use
✅ Used in games, data visualization, 3D websites, and AR/VR

## 🧮 Real-Life Example

A 3D product viewer on an e-commerce site (like Amazon’s “View in 3D”) uses **Three.js** to show the product from all angles.
Even many animated portfolio websites use it to add motion and depth!

| Term         | Meaning                       | Example                           |
| ------------ | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **WebGL**    | Low-level 3D engine using GPU | Hard to use directly              |
| **Three.js** | Library built on WebGL        | Easy 3D creation using JavaScript |
| **Scene**    | Stage for 3D world            | Like a room                       |
| **Camera**   | Viewer’s eye                  | What we see                       |
| **Renderer** | Painter                       | Draws everything                  |


## ✨ In Simple Words:

    WebGL is the base technology.
    Three.js is the friendly helper that makes using WebGL easy and fun 🎮💻
